                  Shane Davis is a Marine Corps Veteran with a background in
                  security working with HMX-1. During his time in the service,
                  Shaneâ€™s travels opened his eyes to the devastating effects of
                  food scarcity for the worlds population. He was also a witness
                  to the effects of over production of farm land and its natural
                  resources. Through research and connection, Shane found
                  permaculture as a solution for problems facing modern food
                  production.
