        a solution to ending hunger in our community, one veggie at a time, but
        Thanks to Plantr , we can all make a difference. You may be surprised at
        how current large scale farming harms our air, our land and our water.
        I’ll be sharing more information with all my Patrons about the
        incredibly positive impact that food forests and organic gardening can
        make to combat the devastating consequences of climate change. Feed
        yourself. Feed the world. What you can do to help? Please consider

        only will you get to feel good about helping, but you will also get the
        inside scoop on how things are coming along. You can also help by
        sharing your ideas and feedback. We will be building Plantr together!

      <h3>Meet the Team</h3>
      <h4>Founder: Shane Davis </h4>
      <p>
        Shane Davis is a Marine Corps Veteran with a background in security
        working with HMX-1. During his time in the service, Shane’s travels
        opened his eyes to the devastating effects of food scarcity for the
        worlds population. He was also a witness to the effects of over
        production of farm land and its natural resources. Through research and
        connection, Shane found permaculture as a solution for problems facing
        modern food production. It dawned on him that a subscription style
        service coupled with the ancient practices of permaculture could provide
        the answer. Plantr App allows for those who want the ability to grow
        fresh food without the “know how”, “time”, or “space”, with the ease of
        a few clicks. This is an opportunity for everyone to make a positive
        impact on their environment, in a way that also fits their lifestyle. At
        Plantr, we believe everyone has the ability to learn this method of
        growing fresh organic food, while preserving the natural environment
        around them. However, we also realize in today’s fast paced world- not
        everyone has the time or energy to commit to the process. Plantr is the
        solution. Reconnecting you to redesign your yard to work for you and
        with your home- while producing sustainably. Plantr creates new local
        jobs for “growrs” and “harvestrs” while healing the natural spaces
        around us. Feed yourself and heal the planet. Do your part with a few
        clicks and harvest the benefits your property has to offer you.
